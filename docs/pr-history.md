# PR History Ledger

This file is the canonical long-term log of merged pull requests that changed behavior, architecture, operations, or documentation. The goal is to preserve review context in a durable, searchable format for both human maintainers and AI agents.

## Policy

- Every merged PR **must append exactly one row** to the table below.
- Keep entries concise but concrete so future readers can reconstruct intent and operational impact.
- If a PR has no docs impact, explicitly record `None` in **Impacted docs**.

## Table schema

| Date (YYYY-MM-DD) | PR link/ID | Scope | Impacted docs | Migration/deploy notes | Rollback note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _Append new merged PR rows below this line_ |  |  |  |  |  |
