## Purpose
This repository does not currently store design-tool binary files. This document provides implementation-oriented wireframe descriptions to align contributors until a dedicated design asset pipeline is added.

## Key screen wireframes (text)

### A) Main feed page
- Top: app header + user state.
- Left/sidebar: navigation and filters.
- Center: article cards with title, source, summary, sentiment, actions.
- Optional panel: map/geographic filters.
- Footer: links and product/legal navigation.

### B) Dashboard page
- KPI tiles at top.
- Trend charts in middle section.
- Activity/recent events list in lower section.

### C) Admin page
- User management panel.
- Content/moderation status panel.
- System health summaries.

### D) Affiliate dashboard
- Campaign and product list.
- Click and conversion metrics.
- Revenue/commission summary.

## Mockup conventions
- Keep readable spacing and card hierarchy.
- Maintain consistent action placement for save/share/subscribe.
- Use sentiment/theme visuals as secondary signals, not primary content.

## Next step
Add Figma/PNG artifacts and link them here with version tags when available.
